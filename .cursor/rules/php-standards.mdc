## Package Version Annotations

When needing to add a package version number inside a DocBlock, please use `WPUF_SINCE` as such:

- `@since WPUF_SINCE`
- `@deprecated WPUF_SINCE`
- `@deprecated since WPUF_SINCE`
- `_deprecated_function( __METHOD__, 'package-WPUF_SINCE' );` (other WordPress deprecation functions also work, but note it must be all on one line).

The `WPUF_SINCE` specifier will be automatically replaced with the correct package version number the next time a new version of that package is released.
