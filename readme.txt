== Description ==

WP User Frontend makes the frontend better for you! It includes frontend dashboard, frontend editor, publishing, and uploader for WordPress user profile, post submissions, and memberships.

<strong>#1 Frontend Post Submission, Membership, Profile Builder, & WordPress Editor Plugin</strong>

<strong>FREE FEATURES</strong>

<strong>Unlimited post-type form creation</strong>

The forms let users create new posts and edit their profile from the site frontend, with no need to access admin panel or backend.

<strong>Update Profile from the Frontend</strong>

This WordPress Profile Plugin allows registered users to edit their profile using default fields from frontend. (Unlimited fields can be added using PRO)

<strong>Flexibility for Admins</strong>

Admins can manage users both from frontend and backend to control who can access the dashboard.

<strong>Featured Image & Image Upload</strong>

Users can upload images and featured image for a post using the Image Upload option on the post content area.

<strong>Drag-and-drop Form Builder</strong>

Quickly build your form with necessary fields using drag-and-drops and real-time preview that updates as you make changes.

<strong>Publish Your WPUF Forms Using Gutenberg</strong>

Easily add your published forms in the Gutenberg editor with the WPUF block. When users want to publish a form on a page, they can simply select it from the drop-down included in the dedicated WPUF block for Gutenberg. The entire form automatically renders within the editor as well as on the page.

<strong>Use Forms Anywhere Easily with Shortcodes</strong>

All of the forms get a unique shortcode which you can paste on any page and the form will generate without breaking the style of your theme.

<strong>WordPress Guest Post Submission</strong>

Enable guests to post from your site frontend without registering with WP User Frontend, the WordPress User Registration plugin. Choose to require name and email address to register automatically and allow them to comment on the posts. Allow email verification for guests.

<strong>Role Based Access Control</strong>

Enable certain user roles to make posts, while restricting others. Create the unauthorized message you want to show to restricted users.

<strong>Submit and Update Anything from Frontend</strong>

Users can upload images, fill out forms, even enter data with multiple choice menus. Allow users to update their posts from the front end.

<strong>Build Customized Forms with Custom Post Types</strong>

Taking advantage of custom post types will allow you to work on any platform. WP User Frontend is WooCommerce supported, so you can also create products for your WooCommerce site using our forms.

<strong>Set Post Status, Post Message, Update Post Button text</strong>

Assign separate default statuses for new posts or edited posts. Set the message you want to show users after form submission and change the text of the submit buttons as you like.

<strong>Custom Redirection After Login and Submission</strong>

Redirect users to another page after logging in, form submission, or editing form submission.

<strong>Earn with Subscription Based Posting</strong>

Create subscription packs to earn through “Pay Per Post” payments. Submissions posted via these subscriptions have duration and posting limits.

<strong>Schedule Forms & Restrict Entries</strong>

Choose to keep your form active for certain dates. Set a message when the form expires. And limit entries to as many as required. The PRO version also allows setting up post expiration.

<strong>Get Reminded with Emails</strong>

Trigger emails on multiple events like new form submissions, guest posts, publish notifications, and new subscriptions. More email notifications can be set up with the PRO version.

<strong>Integrate with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)</strong>

Connect form fields with ACF fields to view user submissions in ACF format from your dashboard. Allow users to edit fields from front end.

<strong>Create Subscription Packs, Pay-per-posts, & Receive Payments from Users</strong>

Create and subscribe users to membership packs, allow pay per post, force subscription package purchase, and set fallback pay per post charges with this WordPress Membership Plugin.

<strong>Manage Transactions and Membership</strong>

Approve or keep membership requests pending – you’re in complete control. View all details from a single screen.

<strong>Manage and Import/Export Forms Easily</strong>

Install required WPUF pages in a click, delete post forms, registration forms, or subscriptions in one go. Import forms from other places and export forms as JSON.

<strong>Custom Login & Registration Form</strong>

This WordPress Registration Form Plugin also allows you to build registration forms using default templates. More fields can be added with PRO.

<strong>Display Custom Fields Data in Post</strong>

Custom field data are viewable to visitors on frontend on single post pages. Admins can also disable this if they don’t want to display custom fields to everyone.

WP User Frontend uses [Appsero](https://appsero.com) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Appsero SDK **does not gather any data by default.** The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure great user experience for all our users.

= Why does the "Edit Post" page show "invalid post id"? =

This page is for the purpose of editing posts. You shouldn't access this page directly.

redirected to the edit page with that post id. Then you'll see the edit post form.
