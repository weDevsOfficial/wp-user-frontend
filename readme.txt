<strong>Unlimited Post-Type Form Creation</strong>

Users can upload images and featured image for a post using the Image Upload option on the post content area.

<strong>Drag-and-drop Form Builder</strong>

Quickly build your form with necessary fields using drag-and-drops and real-time preview that updates as you make changes.

<strong>Publish Your WPUF Forms Using Gutenberg</strong>

Easily add your published forms in the Gutenberg editor with the WPUF block. When users want to publish a form on a page, they can simply select it from the drop-down included in the dedicated WPUF block for Gutenberg. The entire form automatically renders within the editor as well as on the page.

<strong>Use Forms Anywhere Easily with Shortcodes</strong>

All of the forms get a unique shortcode which you can paste on any page and the form will generate without breaking the style of your theme.

Assign separate default statuses for new posts or edited posts. Set the message you want to show users after form submission and change the text of the submit buttons as you like.

<strong>Custom Redirection After Login and Submission</strong>

Redirect users to another page after logging in, form submission, or editing form submission.

<strong>Earn with Subscription Based Posting</strong>

Create subscription packs to earn through “Pay Per Post” payments. Submissions posted via these subscriptions have duration and posting limits.
